Data analysis code and reports for the Aalto IEM course "Creating Value with Analytics"  

Each case folder contains the

This course required crafting data-backed insight to make decisions. The coding assignments were not guided and the code is written by me unless otherwise indicated. I chose to mainly use Python instead of the course's recommended language R, so I did not get to utilize the occasional prewritten code snippets.

I previously studied the course "Machine Learning in Financial engineering" where I learned the basic principles of crafting and understanding machine learning models in Python.
