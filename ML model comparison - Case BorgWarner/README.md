## Machine Learning model comparison case
### Info
Language: R  
_(Part of the code was handed in the assignment)_

Dataset: 204 rows & 15 variables, labeled data

### Task
The task was to find critical variables in a factory production process to increase pass-rate of produced parts.

6 different machine learning prediction models were analyzed to find and choose the most accurate and illustrative one. I determined that Random Forest was most effective wtih this dataset and grpahically represented its prediction trees. This lead to concrete parameters to improve the production process.

### What I learned
* To identify use cases for ML models to improve existing processes
* To implement different ML models in practice and compare their accuracy and interpretability
* To apply different evaluation metrics
