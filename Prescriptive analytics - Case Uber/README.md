## Uber case
### Info
Language: Python in Jupyter notebook

Dataset: .csv file with 126 rows and 11 variables 

### Task
The task was to optimize Uber's new product cost per revenue by analyzing dataset of acquired via switchback tests.

More specifically, I had to formulate a data backed decision whether to increase 2 minute ride-matching time window to 5 minutes in the Uber's new Pool service. Longer waiting period allowed for reducing costs per-ride but could negatively affect the popularity of the service.

Here, I was able to draw conclusion that people were accepting more inconvenience and delays in their trip from work to home. In contrast, in the morning people were less flexible and resorted to other services when the waiting period was longer.

### What I learned
* To manipulate data to visualise patterns based on my hyphothesis
* To see the limitations on conclusions that a narrow dataset allows
* Making data-driven decisions
