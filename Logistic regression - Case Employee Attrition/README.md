## Employee attrition case

### Info
Dataset: Trained on 1731 rows with 12 columns, courtesy of course staff

Language: Python within Jupyter notebook
Packages: Pandas, Sklearn
Editor used: VS Code

### Task
Task was to 
1. Explain reasons for employees leaving the company
2. Identify and evaluate actions to reduce employee turnover and
3. Predict future employee attrition using the dataset.

Main takeaway using logistic regression model was that most impactful variables were personal performance scoring, their bossess performance and overtime amount.

### What I learned
* Use regression models to identify most important variables in labeled dataset
* Construct a prediction model in Python
* ..and evaluate the effectiveness of the prediction model
